## Executive Summary

Hi Kiro! You're being brought on to build the frontend for **Boomerang**, an AI-powered returns processing platform that automates the entire returns workflow for fashion retailers. This is a B2B SaaS product targeting the $550B fashion retail market, specifically addressing the pain point that returns cost retailers 10-15% of revenue annually.

**What you're building**: A web application that allows fashion retailers to process returns 80% faster through AI-powered inspection, automated routing, and fraud detection.

**Why this matters**: Fashion returns are a $200B+ problem. Current manual processes are slow, expensive, and error-prone. We're automating this with computer vision and ML to save retailers millions.

## Market Context & Opportunity

### The Fashion Returns Problem

The fashion industry has a **massive returns problem**:
- Online fashion returns average 30-40% (vs 8% for general retail)
- Processing a single return costs retailers $10-25 in labor
- Manual inspection is slow, inconsistent, and prone to fraud
- Returns processing delays hurt customer satisfaction and cash flow

### Market Size & Validation

**Total Addressable Market**: $200B+ annual returns volume  
**Serviceable Market**: $50B+ (fashion retailers with >$10M annual revenue)  
**Initial Target**: Mid-market fashion retailers ($10M-$500M revenue)

**Validation Sources**:
- Perplexity market research identified this as the #1 most validated AI opportunity in fashion
- Returns processing consistently ranks as top operational pain point in retailer surveys
- Existing solutions (manual processes, basic automation) are insufficient

---

## Product Vision & Strategy

### Vision Statement
"Make returns processing invisible to retailers by automating every decision with AI that matches human-level accuracy at machine speed."

### Product Positioning
- **Primary**: AI-powered returns processing platform
- **Secondary**: Operational efficiency tool for fashion retailers
- **Differentiation**: End-to-end automation vs. point solutions

### Business Model
- **B2B SaaS**: Monthly/annual subscriptions
- **Pricing**: Tiered based on returns volume (e.g., $0.50-$2.00 per return processed)
- **Go-to-Market**: Direct sales to mid-market retailers, partnerships with fulfillment centers
