# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Boomerang is an AI-powered returns processing platform designed to automate the entire returns workflow for fashion retailers. The MVP focuses on core functionality that enables retailers to process returns 80% faster through AI-powered inspection, automated routing, and basic analytics. This addresses the critical pain point where fashion returns cost retailers 10-15% of revenue annually due to manual, slow, and error-prone processes.

The target users are returns operations managers, customer service managers, and finance/operations directors at mid-market fashion retailers ($10M-$500M revenue) who currently struggle with manual return processing bottlenecks, inconsistent decisions, and fraud losses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a returns operations manager, I want to see all pending returns in a centralized dashboard so that I can efficiently prioritize and process them without switching between multiple systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the returns dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all pending returns in a sortable table format
2. WHEN I view the returns queue THEN the system SHALL show return status, priority level, AI confidence score, and processing timestamp for each item
3. WHEN returns are processed by other users or automated systems THEN the dashboard SHALL update in real-time without requiring page refresh
4. WHEN I need to process multiple returns THEN the system SHALL provide bulk selection capabilities with keyboard shortcuts
5. WHEN I want to focus on specific types of returns THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options by status, date range, confidence level, and return reason
6. WHEN I view daily metrics THEN the system SHALL display processing volume, completion rate, and average processing time for the current day

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a returns operations manager, I want AI to automatically analyze return condition and provide recommendations so that I can make faster, more accurate decisions without manual inspection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a return for inspection THEN the system SHALL display all uploaded return images with zoom and pan functionality
2. WHEN AI analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL show condition assessment, confidence percentage, and specific recommendation (full refund, partial refund, or reject)
3. WHEN the AI detects issues THEN the system SHALL highlight problem areas on images with visual annotations and provide detailed explanations
4. WHEN I disagree with AI recommendation THEN the system SHALL allow manual override with required reasoning that gets logged for audit purposes
5. WHEN AI confidence is below 85% THEN the system SHALL automatically flag the return for manual review
6. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL complete AI analysis within 3 seconds and display loading states during processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a returns operations manager, I want approved returns to automatically trigger appropriate actions so that I can focus on edge cases rather than routine processing tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a return is approved with high confidence (>95%) THEN the system SHALL automatically process full refund and update inventory
2. WHEN a return is approved for partial refund THEN the system SHALL route to manual review queue with suggested refund amount
3. WHEN any return action is taken THEN the system SHALL send automated status notifications to customers via email
4. WHEN inventory updates occur THEN the system SHALL mark items as restockable or damaged based on AI assessment
5. WHEN bulk actions are performed THEN the system SHALL process all selected returns and provide progress feedback with ability to cancel
6. WHEN automated actions fail THEN the system SHALL log errors, notify administrators, and revert to manual processing queue

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a finance/operations director, I want to view processing metrics and performance analytics so that I can track ROI, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven operational decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the analytics dashboard THEN the system SHALL display key metrics including processing volume, accuracy rate, cost savings, and fraud detection statistics
2. WHEN I want to analyze trends THEN the system SHALL provide time-based charts showing processing performance over selectable date ranges (daily, weekly, monthly)
3. WHEN I need to report to stakeholders THEN the system SHALL allow export of analytics data in PDF and CSV formats
4. WHEN I want to drill down into specific metrics THEN the system SHALL provide detailed breakdowns by return reason, product category, and processing outcome
5. WHEN fraud is detected THEN the system SHALL display fraud alerts with pattern analysis and recommended actions
6. WHEN comparing performance THEN the system SHALL show before/after metrics demonstrating processing time improvements and cost reductions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a customer service manager, I want to quickly access return status and processing history so that I can provide accurate updates to customers and resolve inquiries efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for a specific return THEN the system SHALL provide instant search results by order number, customer email, or product SKU
2. WHEN I view return details THEN the system SHALL display complete processing timeline with timestamps, actions taken, and responsible users
3. WHEN customers inquire about return status THEN the system SHALL provide customer-friendly status descriptions and estimated completion times
4. WHEN I need to escalate issues THEN the system SHALL allow flagging returns for management review with priority levels and notes
5. WHEN processing delays occur THEN the system SHALL automatically notify customer service team with suggested customer communication templates

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a returns operations manager, I want secure user authentication and role-based access controls so that sensitive return data and financial actions are properly protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN they SHALL authenticate using multi-factor authentication with email and SMS options
2. WHEN user roles are assigned THEN the system SHALL enforce permissions where operations managers can process returns, customer service can view status, and directors can access all analytics
3. WHEN sensitive actions are performed THEN the system SHALL log all user activities with timestamps, IP addresses, and action details for audit compliance
4. WHEN users are inactive THEN the system SHALL automatically log them out after 30 minutes and require re-authentication
5. WHEN password requirements are enforced THEN the system SHALL require minimum 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, and special characters
6. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL encrypt all communications using TLS 1.3 and encrypt sensitive data at rest

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a returns operations manager, I want the system to handle high volumes and perform reliably so that processing doesn't slow down during peak return periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display within 2 seconds even with 1000+ pending returns
2. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL handle files up to 10MB and support common formats (JPEG, PNG, WEBP)
3. WHEN multiple users work simultaneously THEN the system SHALL support 50+ concurrent users without performance degradation
4. WHEN real-time updates occur THEN the system SHALL deliver status changes within 500ms via WebSocket connections
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN the application SHALL display user-friendly error messages and gracefully degrade functionality
6. WHEN the system is under load THEN it SHALL maintain 99.5% uptime during business hours with automatic failover capabilities
